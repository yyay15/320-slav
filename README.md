# egb320-group13-2020
 
This repository contains the source code written by Group 13 for the EGB320 Luna Rover Challenge. Python OOP was used, with a class for each subsystem. The source code is located in the Scripts folder, where there is a subfolder for each subsystem. 

The slavesMain.py file interfaces between the four subsystems and contains the main program loop and manual control. The mobility script is found as mobility.py, sample-management as collection.py, vision as vison3.py and for the navigation system, navigation.py and state.py.
